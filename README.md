# Moesh's Development Tools
This is my set of development tools. Currently, the only tool will create a checkboard pattern centered in 136 0 136. This allows me to use use only one region file when releasing projects, as well as having 13x13 spawn chunks instead of the usual 12x12.

## Installation
_Designed for Minecraft: Java Edition 1.14+_

Download and place in your world save folder.
